        Joel Hale was a competitive gymnast and diver in college. He coached gymnastics at a high level as a career until 2000. 
        He developed software to assist with workout analysis and tracking for gymnasts. In 2000, 
        he switched careers and became a software engineer. He's appeared on TV a few times in his capacity as a gymnast and coach. 
        He's been published several times in gymnastics technical journals. He was also a competitive swing dancer for many years. 
        He is an amateur musician and songwriter. One of his biggest pet peeves is people who write about themselves in the third person.
